## Image Classification for Loaded and Unloaded Vehicle States

This project aims to classify images of vehicles as either 'Loaded' or 'Unloaded' using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The images are preprocessed, augmented, and then used to train a CNN model to achieve accurate classification.

### Libraries Required:
<ul><li>numpy</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>scikit-learn</li>
<li>opencv-python</li>
<li>keras</li>
<li>imgaug</li>

### Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python keras imgaug

### Loading and Displaying Images:
The images are loaded from the specified folders, cropped to the region of interest, and stored for further processing.

### Data Augmentation:
Various augmentation techniques are applied to increase the dataset size and diversity.

### Results
